Agriculture is the backbone of the global economy, yet it faces significant challenges due to plant diseases, unpredictable weather, and lack of timely information. Traditional methods of disease identification are manual, time-consuming, and often inaccurate, leading to substantial yield losses (estimated at 30-40\% globally).

\textbf{AgroMind Grow} is a comprehensive, AI-driven smart agriculture platform designed to address these challenges. The core of the system is a Deep Learning model based on the \textbf{EfficientNet-B2} architecture, capable of identifying 38 different plant disease classes with high accuracy. Unlike existing solutions, AgroMind Grow integrates a robust validation layer that filters out non-plant images to prevent false diagnoses.

Beyond disease prediction, the platform serves as a holistic digital assistant for farmers, integrating real-time \textbf{Weather Forecasts}, live \textbf{Market Prices}, personalized \textbf{Crop Calendars}, and an expert \textbf{Knowledge Base}. The system is built using a modern technology stack comprising \textbf{React.js} for the frontend and \textbf{FastAPI} for the backend, ensuring scalability and performance.

This report details the design, implementation, and testing of AgroMind Grow, highlighting its potential to empower farmers with actionable insights, thereby improving crop health and ensuring food security.
